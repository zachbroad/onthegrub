Flutter app, geared towards connecting users, events, and food trucks and providing the best service and features to mediate between these three avenues.

We serve as a directory for food trucks that are both mobile (trucks that move to multiple different locations at different times during the week, [or even the day]), and stationary.

The features that we will release with are as follows:

    - Truck profiles
        - Location
        - Reviews
        - Images
        - Menu
        - Claim
    - Truck dashboard - Allows the truck owners to manage their truck
        - Location
        - Go live at current or future location at a future time
